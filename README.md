# hello-world
As I want to work with GitHub now, I have to do first steps. Therefore I want to learn:
* branches :white_check_mark:
* forking
* pull requests :white_check_mark:
* merging :white_check_mark:

First mission accomplished, but more questions arise:
* what if making a pull request **without branching before**? :white_check_mark:
* what happens if I create a issue?
* learn [mastering markup](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
