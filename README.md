# hello-world
As I want to work with GitHub now, I have to do first steps. Therefore I want to learn:
* branches (/)
* forking
* pull requests (/)
* merging (/)

First mission accomplished, but more questions arise:
* what if making a pull request **without branching before**? (/)
* what happens if I create a issue?
